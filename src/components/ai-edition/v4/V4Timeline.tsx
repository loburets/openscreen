// ponytail: cuts ONLY, deliberately. It used to ask for zooms too ("smart
// zoom-ins on the moments where the cursor dwells… focused on the cursor's
// location"), and the model has no way to do that well: measured on a real 66s
// screencast, every trim it emitted landed strictly inside a true silence with a
// 0.06–0.33s margin and destroyed zero speech, while 7 of its 9 zoom focus points
// missed the actual cursor position in their own window — three of them by more
// than a third of the frame. It places zooms from what the transcript SAYS, not
// from where the pointer WAS. Asking for both in one breath bought misaimed zooms
// at the price of the cuts' credibility, and the cursor-driven wand next to it
// already does the zoom pass from the same telemetry, deterministically.
